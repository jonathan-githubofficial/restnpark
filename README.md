<br>DM Sans is a modern sans-serif typeface designed by Colophon Foundry. It is a highly legible and functional typeface that works well in a wide range of applications, from headlines and body text to user interfaces and branding materials.

### Color Palette

<br>Black and white: The combination of black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF) creates a strong contrast that can be used to make other colors stand out. For example, white text on a black background can be very legible and attention-grabbing.
<br>Teal and orange: The combination of teal (#138E5A) and orange (#B75616) creates a complementary color scheme that is eye-catching and bold. This combination can work well for action-oriented themes.
<br>Dark backgrounds: The dark brown (#231B12), dark green (#284837), and black (#000000) can be used together as a dark, moody background for other elements to pop against. For example, white text or brightly colored graphics can be placed on top of this dark background to create a striking contrast.
